A little bit of me:
I started studying programming back in high school but soon enough, at my third year, i dropped school for health reasons. So for many years i took a break,
even because i didn't have much knowledge, so after many years i came back to programming. At the beginning i felt devasted, because there is so much to learn
that it becomes really frustrating, but now i know that patience rewards best with a calm attitude. If you are struggling hang in there, don't give up!
